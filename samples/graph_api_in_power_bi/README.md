*   [Download](solution/GetOrganizationUsers.zip) the `GetOrganizationUsers.zip` from the `solution` folder
*   [Import](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/import-export-bap-packages/) the `GetOrganizationUsers.zip` file using **My Flows** > **Import** > **Upload** within Microsoft Flow.
*   [Download](powerbi/getorganizationusers.pbit) the `getorganizationusers.pbit` from the `powerbi` folder

### Import Get Organization Users Solution

1. Select the **When a HTTP request is recieved** trigger and copy the ***HTTP Post URL***.

### Power BI File
1.   Download the Power BI Template found under the `powerbi` folder.
1. Edit the Query and replay the URL with the ***HTTP Post URL*** copied previously.
1. **Data Source Credentials** should be set as Anonymous.
1. Save the File and Refresh the Data. Power BI should will now send request to Power Automate, get Organization Users and populate the query.
