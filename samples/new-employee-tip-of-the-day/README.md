The flow was created to fulfill real case scenario to improve new employee introduction process. Every new employee at the beginning may be overwhelmed with the amout of knowladge they need to learn. The flow is supposed to run every day (once a day). Retrieves employees added from newEmployee list (gets the emails).

If there is any newEmployee item the flow gets tip to be sent to the user with helpfull information

![newEmployeeTipsList](assets/newEmployeeTipsList.jpg "newEmployeeTipsList")

and sends it to the user personal chat in MS Teams as an adaptive card.

When all tips are sent to the user the next day the flow removes the  employee item from the least (clean up)
